0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
DESCRIPTION
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! The goal of this project is to build a simple version of the AirBnB website, complete with a command interpreter, a website, a database, and an API.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is the backbone of the project and is used for data manipulation and management. It provides a command-line interface for performing operations on data, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects.

Starting the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, run the following command in your terminal:
python3 console.py

Using the Command Interpreter
The command interpreter supports a number of commands, including:

create: Create a new object of a specified type
show: Show an object of a specified type and ID
all: Show all objects of a specified type
update: Update an object of a specified type and ID
destroy: Delete an object of a specified type and ID
quit: Exit the command interpreter
